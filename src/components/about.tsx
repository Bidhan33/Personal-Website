            As a final-year student at Haaga-Helia University, I specialize in
            cybersecurity and software development. My passion lies in creating
            secure, scalable applications and implementing robust cloud solutions.

            Currently pursuing AWS SysOps Administrator certification, I bring
            hands-on experience from my role as an IT Support Engineer at Classic
            Tech in Nepal, where I honed my skills in system administration and
            cloud operations.

            My unique blend of technical expertise in both development and security
            allows me to approach projects with a comprehensive understanding of
            modern software requirements and best practices.
